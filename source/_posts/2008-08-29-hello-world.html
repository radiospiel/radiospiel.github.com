<p>Hey, welcome at 1rad!</p>

<p>What I try to do here is to share some of my Ruby and Rails insights with you, folks. But one word of warning: this blog is not about how wonderful Ruby and Rails are. This blog is about real solutions for real coders. And real coders know that every tool sucks at times. So do Ruby and Rails.</p>

<p>The blog's name, though, suggests a new article each day. This won't happen. I will publish one article every monday at 6 CET. Until I am running out of articles and ideas, that is. Once 1rad is up and running you are welcome to comment. If you share my ideas about Ruby and Rails you might even offer to contribute some articles of your own... but we won't get to <strong>that</strong> stage before November.</p>

<p>Have fun around here!</p>
