Ah yes! One year ago I prepared to move my blog to posterous.com. Just when I was ready to move the DNS name, Twitter announced it acquired that service. Well, this is what I call unlucky timing.

But still: posterous.com did run this blog since, and usually without much hassle. But now it will be gone for for good, and I needed a new hosting infrastructure. 

However, the departure of the posterous.com web service teached me one thing: no longer will I rely for a web service to host my blog. Remember: this is not the first move, radiospiel.org lived in many places throughout the times, and with each change of the hoster some content was lost. (As is now: comments are gone, and some timestamps are wrong...) 

So: this time I will use a static blog generator: [http://octopress.org](http://octopress.org). After all, static files cannot get lost, right? So, wherever these pages are living in the net: I can just move them to wherever I like.

This time again the comments will be lost. And the ability to automatically post to Twitter and Facebook whenever I write something - but I will try to add this later. And I can't post from a browser no longer. And there is no mobile app.

Can't have the cake and eat it too...
