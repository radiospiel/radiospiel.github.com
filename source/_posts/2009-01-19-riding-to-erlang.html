<p>Hi guys, I just want to tell you that I am off that blog, for now. The reason is this <a href="http://github.com/pboy/eep0018/">cute sidekick</a>. And this being a somewhat non-Railsy project there is not much of a point in writing about it here. In the meantime this blog might get somewhat quiet, but I expect to be back in Railsland in two weeks or so. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>My sidekick is quite exciting though: I got the parsing speed of Json files up to 500% of competing implementations. Wow, am I proud... And yes, I cheated a bit: I am doing native C.</p>
