<p>It seems tweeting is the back door to customer support these days:&nbsp;After the previous blog post and related tweet Rich from posterous finally got back to me. And then got the posterours developer team to fix the issue in their gem (<a href="https://github.com/posterous/posterous-gem/commit/d2e8510f08249bfff3cccb4d5f12f4add725345a)">https://github.com/posterous/posterous-gem/commit/d2e8510f08249bfff3cccb4d5f1...</a> Thank you, Rich!</p>
<p>Meaning: I could finally move here. Back to blogging!</p>
