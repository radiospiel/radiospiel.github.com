<p>Rails dynamic streaming doesn't work. At least sometimes. While the Rails documentation, and all the euphoric comments in the community feature code examples along the lines of</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre># Renders &quot;Hello from code!&quot;
render :text =&gt; proc { |response, output| 
  output.write(&quot;Hello from code!&quot;) }</pre></div>
</div>


<p>But this just doesn't work as not-really-advertised. The reason? While rails correctly - that is to say in the way it is documented - does write directly to the output stream, at least with Mongrel the output stream is just a String.</p>

<p>So whatever you are doing: the entire request is still collected in RAM. Bummer!</p>
