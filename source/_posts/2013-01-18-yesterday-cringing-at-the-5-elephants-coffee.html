<p>a middle aged german woman - the kind that probably votes the Green party since ever - comes through the door, approaches the counter, and says something like (in german): "While I do speak english fine enough, I insist on talking german now." To a barista that does speak german a bit, but english way better (no surprise, she probably being native US anyways).</p>
<p>Didn't she see how gross and fremdenfeindlich that is?</p>
<p>If you don't know it yet: 5 elephants is an american style coffee bar run by americans just around my corner. These guys running a website also: <a href="http://www.fiveelephant.com">http://www.fiveelephant.com</a>, and I can recommend their coffee.</p>
