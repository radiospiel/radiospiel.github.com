<p>Whoever designed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)">F#</a> did certainly not have a german programmer in mind. Or how would you explain this</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>(* Print even fibs *)
[1 .. 10]
|&gt; List.map     fib
|&gt; List.filter  (fun n -&gt; (n mod 2) = 0)
|&gt; printlist</pre></div>
</div>


<p>The pipe on a German Mac keyboard is &lt;Alt&gt; + &lt;7&gt;, which in itself ok; but directly followed by a '&gt;' - which is &lt;ShiftAlt&gt; + &lt;the key right next to shift&gt; is absolute nightmare for anyone with delicate bones in the left wrist. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_stress_syndrome">RSS</a>: you nearly got me, but then I still prefer other functional languages.</p>
