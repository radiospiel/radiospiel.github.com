Sometimes I don't code, sometimes I am radio-active. I was asked to support a group 
of students at the Berlin Humboldt University in creating an episode of their [Kulturwelle](http://kulturwelle.hu-berlin.de) radio show.
That episode is all about acceleration of time in modern societies, and yes, you can hear yours truly ~40 minutes into the show.

Curious? Make sure to tune in to piradio 88.4 MHz at 2013/3/20 8:30pm.
