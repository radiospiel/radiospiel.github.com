<p>Assume you are living in Europe. Your home currency is EUR. As it so happens in todays global economy, sometimes you stumble upon an online shop outside of Europe that lets you pay only via Paypal.</p>

<p>As a German customer you usually have your checking account and one or more credit cards registered with Paypal. You&rsquo;ll need the checking account in case you receive money; and the credit card is good for actually paying something, because you still earn loyalty points or so.</p>

<p>This just happened to me: I wanted to checkout items at some <a href="http://morphic.co.nz">New Zealand store</a>. When I went through with the checkout Paypal automatically converted the NZD amount into EUR at a really bad rate: 1.50 vs 1.57 or so &ndash; which is a cut of more than 4 percent already! After that they ask me to use my checking account instead of my credit card for the payment, because, so they say, my credit card company would charge me ~3% for international use, and oh are they nice to point that out&hellip;</p>

<p>Well, this is a blatant lie: AFAIK CC issuers do not charge extra for international payments, but for non-EUR payments. Which this one isn&rsquo;t any more since paypal already forced me into a EUR payment. On top of that my credit card company used a fair exchange rate. And also untrue: my credit card company only charges 0.5% for non EUR payments; mentioning 3% seems a bit exaggerated.</p>

<p>Instead, I think, paypal prefers to charge my checking account instead of my credit card because that is basically free (~ 0.5%), while <em>they</em> would have to pay an ~2% costs when I used my credit card.</p>

<p>So paypal chooses to</p>

<ul>
<li>force me into a really bad exchange rate to earn an additional 4% on top of the already 3% or so charge the online shop has to bear,</li>
<li>and feed me lies about my CC issuer to save on processing costs.</li>
</ul>


<p>I think I will never use paypal on a non-EUR transaction again. And if you are running an online store: please consider adding a non-paypalled credit card payment options.</p>
