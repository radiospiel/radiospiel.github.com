<p>This one took me a while. I tried to install Ubuntu 12.10 alongside an existing Windows 7 installation on a x121e from an USB stick. And while the installation itself went smoothless, the boot configuration was not written properly.</p>

<p>The reason? Something prevented the master boot record to be written. Hence no grub and no way to choose the Linux OS to be booted. The solution: <strong>disable UEFI boot mode in the thinkpad&rsquo;s BIOS</strong>! The default setting tries to be smart: try booting in UEFI mode, and if that fails boot in legacy mode. But this didn&rsquo;t work, even though the disk itself is in legacy mode.</p>

<p>So save some time, disable UEFI boot mode, and you are good to go.</p>
