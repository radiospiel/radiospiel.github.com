<p>If you need to access the XCode documentation frequently, then <a href="http://fileability.net/ingredients/">Ingredients.app</a> is for you.
Give it a try: it is just easier to use than XCode&rsquo;s builtin documentation browser.</p>

<p><img src="http://fileability.net/ingredients/screenshots/1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>But there is a gotcha: if you are <strong>on the latest XCode, both the official stable and beta binaries do not work!</strong> Ingredients
being open sourced, someone fixed that bug already and pushed it at github, and the buys behind Ingredients.app merged it
in already. So everyone is waiting for a new download.</p>

<p><strong>Wait no longer!</strong> I compiled and built a binary for you. Until the Ingredients team comes with a new download package, you could just use <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/33495413/radiospiel/Ingredients.app.zip">this one</a>. This is a debug build, with one exception: it skips question at startup,
whether you would like Ingredients to forget all settings and cached documents.</p>
