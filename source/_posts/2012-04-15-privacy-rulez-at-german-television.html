<p>The german state TV "ARD" puts a <a href="http://revierderby-panorama.de/" title="panoramic phiotography">panoramic photography</a> showing ~15000 football fans online, asking everyone to makr him/herself and his/her friends in the photo. Without asking anyone for permission, that is.</p>
<p>To opt out from that these guys would like to have a "copy of your driver's license" and a phone number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well done, ARD. It's good to see my tax euros at work.</p>
