<h1>0x31 - A catch22 ahead: Free high quality web fonts</h1>

<p>Finally <a href="http://webfonts.fonts.com/">someone</a> gives us free, legal, high quality web fonts in large numbers. Good bye <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=MS+Arial" target="_blank">MS Arial</a>! Good bye <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=MS+Trebuchet" target="_blank">MS Trebuchet</a>!</p>

<p>But not so fast, it seems. Apparently you have to sign up to use these fonts. Well, no prob, we know such things already. And then you need to create an "application", which will be checked by someone. If you succeed (fonts.com doesn't say much about which criteria to meet) they will send you a password.</p>

<p>And now the catch22: you need a password to create an application.</p>

<p>If someone succeeds in registering: drop me a comment.</p>

<p>UPDATE: As so often, asking nicely helps :)</p>
