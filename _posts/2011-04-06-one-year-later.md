<h1>0x40 - One year later</h1>

<p>Yea, there is a thing with blogs that they require permanent attention. Or they don't exist. Now, after nearly one year of non-existence lets push radiospiel.org back into existence.</p>

<p>I do have an excuse though: I had an exciting year. (Yea, and I hate those "We are excited about our new product" as much as you probably do, but I really had an exciting year.) I was involved with Whispler starting and failing <a href="http://whispler.com">whispler.com</a>, created <a href="http://socially.io/?id=mall">socially.io's The Mall</a> and pulled its plug, pariticpated in the  <a href="http://nerdart.org/">nerdart exhibition</a> (thanks for the great logo once more, chris!), built <a href="http://nerdart.org/nerdromancer.html">Nerd Art's Nerd romancer</a>, travelled the world hi &amp; lo, and last but not least attended to my Software Architect job at <a href="http://mediapeers.com">mediapeers</a></p>

<p>In the course of that time I wrote some pieces of software - related to Ruby, Javascript, Databases in general - that I think are great stuff, and I will probably release some of them into the wild this year (stay tuned.) But this year will be different: while Ruby is likely to remain my favorite programming language, my main focus is likely to shift towards Mobile Development.</p>
