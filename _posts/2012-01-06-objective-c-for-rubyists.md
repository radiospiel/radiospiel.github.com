<h1>0x41 - Objective C for rubyists</h1>

<p>Yesterdays rug.b meeting had me talking on Objective C, tailored for rubyists. I really had fun deliver the talk; but there was some strange issue with the raum zeit kontinuum: when I was done 70 minutes had passed away... So this is to apologize for wolfram, who cancelled his talk because of that.</p>

<p>If you miss the slides: you can find these <a href="http://oc4r.heroku.com">here</a>. And kudos to @bartaz for <a href="https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js">impress.js</a>.</p>
