<p><a href="https://www.mywickr.com/">wickr</a> promises to let you communicate with others in a secure fashion from your phone &ndash; and have your messages dfestroyed after a while. It is free…</p>

<p>…and yet is a ripoff.</p>

<p>There is <strong>NO SECURITY</strong> to be had on mobile devices. Think about it: you need a strong password to set up strong encryption. Do you need to enter a 40 character string in Wickr each time you start the app? No you don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>That lets wickr &ndash; and in fact any mobile app &ndash; with two choices: generate a strong password and store it in an unsafe place &ndash; on the device which is probably secured with a 4-digit-pins only. Or ask the user for a (then) weak password and use that, which leaves wickr users with encredibly easy to break security.</p>

<p>And then: self-destructing messages? Ha! This is not how the net works. It is actually quite easy to interfere with internet routing in such a way that messages you send or received can be intercepted and stored by others. (Note: that doesn&rsquo;t mean they would be immediately readable. But throw in the weak security inherent to mobile devices&hellip; well, there goes security.) Meaning: Wickr probably destroys a message&rsquo;s copy on their own servers, and in your device and so on; but they can&rsquo;t do nothing with other potential copies of the message itself.</p>

<p>To add <strong>REAL SECURITY</strong> to mobile devices we need a sufficiently secure and yet convinient way to set some kind of secret; something like a PIN, but with much more numbers. At this time, noone has anything to offer in that department.</p>

<p>What you get with Wickr is a weak concept with a nice UI; but a weak concept nevertheless. Bad security is actually worse then no security &ndash; think about it!</p>
